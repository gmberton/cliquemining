# Close, But Not There: Boosting Geographic Distance Sensitivity in Visual Place Recognition 
Sergio Izquierdo, Javier Civera

Code and models for the ECCV 2024 paper "Close, But Not There: Boosting Geographic Distance Sensitivity in Visual Place Recognition" (CliqueMining)

## Summary

In this repo, we include a novel mining pipeline, CliqueMining, that creates very difficult batches. It creates a graph of very similar images and samples cliques (representing places) to create challenging batches. This technique improves performance on many common datasets.

For more details, check the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02422).

## Weights

You can download the weights of the trained model [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B06ysb-Wjb4KDcNrl-7pyj1mJve1jqdk/view?usp=sharing). To evaluate, follow the same steps as with [SALAD](https://github.com/serizba/salad).
